Today is October 25, 2018. It has been exactly 1 week since my 21st birthday. 
I give thanks to the people who have been in my life to this point, and the people who I will soon encounter.
Life is about experiences, and as a 21 year old in America, I feel that I am now able to do so much more.

I have always been anxious in my life, but now I feel less stress, and the ability to hold myself to higher standards. I am not viewed as a child anymore, but as a peer to those around me in all walks of life.
I feel that I can truly act as a responsible adult in many ways. 

The door has only just been opened, I cannot wait to see what is just beyond it as I embark on this new adventure in my life.
